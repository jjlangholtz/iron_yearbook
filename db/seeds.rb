He briefly managed a media school (www.sae.edu) and occasionally lectured on graphic design. His last public speaking gig landed him his dream job at JWT Advertising. Fun Fact: In 2005 a group of bloggers in Kuwait organized a rally to persuade the government to recognize women as equal citizens by granting them the right to vote and run for election. Talal was inspired to join the movement and designed a handmade stenciled t-shirt celebrating women (he’s wearing in the picture). The publicity of the shirt promoted him to launch his own line of t-shirts (tatabotata.com) which to this day maintains a small, yet loyal cult-like following. Thanks to the brave protestors in Kuwait, later in 2005, women were granted the right to vote and run for election!',
